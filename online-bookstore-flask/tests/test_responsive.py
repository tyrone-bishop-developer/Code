"""
Optional UI responsiveness tests (FR-007).

This module is designed to validate that the application layout adapts
correctly across different devices (mobile, tablet, desktop). Since this is
primarily a front-end responsibility, these tests may be performed using
automated UI testing tools (e.g., Selenium, Cypress) or manual inspection.
